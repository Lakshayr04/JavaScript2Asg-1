                <p>Sushant Singh Rajput 21 January 1986- 14 June 2020 was an Indian actor known for his work in Hindi cinema. He starred in a number of commercially 
                    successful Hindi films such as M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, Kedarnath and Chhichhore.</p> 
                    
                <p>Rajput began his acting career after dropping out of his engineering course at the Delhi College of Engineering and entering the theatre industry in 
                    Mumbai.</p>
                <p>Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh. His father is a retired technical 
                officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna.</p>

                <p>During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[9] Soon afterward, he also began 
                    attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.[17][18] Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted 
                    to continue doing it forever.[19] He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's performance at the 
                    closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.</p>
                <p> In 2006, he dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and performance.[21][22] He moved to Mumbai, took 
                    up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.[23] Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute 
                    in which he remained for two and a half years.</p>
                <p>He was spotted by a casting team of Balaji Telefilms while he was working at the Prithvi Theatre. Rajput was subsequently called for an audition 
                    and cast as a second lead in the television series Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil in 2008. He had secured the role of Preet Singh Juneja, the 
                    stepbrother of the lead named Harshad Chopda and entered the show in its seventh episode.

                <p>Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention.[156][157] In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta 
                    co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;[32] both of them had participated in the show 
                    as competing contestants.</p>
                <p>The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other. 
                   In 2012, they began living together, and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in the media.</p>
                        
                <p>In an interview, Rajput stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred 
                  and the latter as a crime. At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to 
                            say that I am in a relationship".</p>
